    "# Supplementary Source Code 1 - Crop Imaging on CropQuant\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook describes the crop imaging script designed for the single-board computer, Raspberry Pi, on CropQuant workstation. The algorithm below has been optimised for Pi computers and unnecessary libraries such as SimpleCV has been removed due to power consumption issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "This script will capture time-lapse image series through the CropQuant hardware and remove low-quality images if they are dark, out-of-focus, or taken in low lighting conditions. The script will provide a GUI for users to enter experiment related details and imaging frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Please note that:\n",
    "1. A Jupyter notebook is ONLY used for demonstrating the algorithm, NOT for batch processing big crop image series. \n",
    "2. The performance of the algorithm provided for the CropQuant breeding project could be varied due to an end-user's computing resources such as physical memory and CPU speed. \n",
    "3. Users might encounter issues with specific libraries if they have not installed properly or not been optimised for Linux-based operating systems. \n",
    "4. For all Scikit-image or Scikit-learning functions, authors recommend users to preinstall the latest open Anaconda Python distribution. \n"
